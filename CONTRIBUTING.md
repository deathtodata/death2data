## Code Style

### HTML/CSS

- Use the design tokens from `skills/death2data-skill/SKILL.md`
- Keep the dark theme consistent
- Use `Space Mono` for headings, `Instrument Sans` for body
- Include noise texture overlay on all pages
- Mobile-responsive (test at 600px width)

### Commit Messages

Keep them short and clear:

```
Add status page for uptime monitoring
Fix mobile layout on docs sidebar
Update copy on landing page hero
```

No need for conventional commits or special formatting.

## Pull Request Process

1. **One thing per PR** — Don't bundle unrelated changes
2. **Describe what you changed** — A sentence or two is fine
3. **Include screenshots** — If you changed anything visual
4. **Test locally first** — Make sure it works

We'll review and merge quickly if it looks good.

## Design System

All pages should follow the Death2Data design system:

- **Colors**: `--black: #0a0a0a`, `--white: #f5f5f5`, `--red: #ff3333`, `--green: #00ff66`
- **Fonts**: Space Mono (headings), Instrument Sans (body)
- **Effects**: Noise texture overlay, optional scan lines
- **Voice**: Direct, technical, slightly rebellious

See `skills/death2data-skill/SKILL.md` for full documentation.
