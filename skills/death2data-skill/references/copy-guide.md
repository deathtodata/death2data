## Voice Principles

1. **Direct** — Say it plainly. No jargon, no fluff.

3. **Rebellious** — We're against surveillance capitalism. Make that clear.
4. **Confident** — We know our product is good. No hedging.

## Manifesto (Long-form)

Use on landing page or about section:

> Every search you make is tracked, profiled, and sold. Google knows what you're thinking before you finish typing. That's not a feature. That's surveillance.
>
> We're building the alternative. Search that works without watching you. Infrastructure you control. Privacy by architecture, not by promise.
